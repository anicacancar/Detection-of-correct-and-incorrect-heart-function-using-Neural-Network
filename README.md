# Detection-of-correct-and-incorrect-heart-function-using-Neural-Network

Dataset used in this project is called ECG Heartbeat Categorization Dataset from Kaggle:

https://www.kaggle.com/shayanfazeli/heartbeat

We are using following datasets: ptdb_abnormal.csv and ptdb_normal.csv. First dataset represents abnormaln and second normal heart function. 

In this project main goal is to make neural network that after training will be able to recognize normal and abnormal heartbeat. This dataset has 187 features for 14452 samples of data. Neural network will have 187 inputs and 1 output.

# Results

This dataset is not balanced so we are using f1 score as a rate of performances.
